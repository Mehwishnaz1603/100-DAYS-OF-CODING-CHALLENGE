//Q40: Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. 
//The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a
//Object containing these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries
//representing different albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the 
//album information correctly. Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store 
//the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks,
//add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes the number
// of tracks on an album.
function make_album(artistName: string, title: string){
    return {artistName, title}
}
  let album_1 = make_album("Atif Aslam","Ao Madiney chalay")
  let album_2 = make_album("NFAK", "Kamli Waly")
  let album_3 = make_album("Amjad Sabri","Bhardo Jholi Meri Ya Muhammad")
  console.log(album_1)
  console.log(album_2)
  console.log(album_3)
//////Number Of Track////
function make_album_2(artistName: string, title: string, noOfTracks: number){
   return {artistName, title, noOfTracks}
}
let album_4 = make_album_2("Atif Aslam","Ao Madiney chalay", 8)
let album_5 = make_album_2("NFAK", "Kamli Waly", 16)
let album_6 = make_album_2("Amjad Sabri","Bhardo Jholi",0)
  console.log(album_4)
  console.log(album_5)
  console.log(album_6)

//Q41: Magicians: Make a array of magicianâ€™s names. Pass the array to a function 
//called show_magicians(), which prints the name of each magician in the array.

let magician_name: string[] = ["Jack Nelson", "Herry Brown", "Peter","Henry"]
function show_magicians(magicin_name: string[]) {
    magician_name.forEach(magician_name => {
        console.log(magician_name)
    })
}
show_magicians(magician_name)

//Q42: Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. 
//Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians
//by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians()
//to see that the list has actually been modified.

let magicians_name: string[] = ["Harry Houdini", "Peter nelson","Azur russel"]
function make_Great() {
    magicians_name.splice(3, 0, "The Great")
    console.log(magicians_name)
